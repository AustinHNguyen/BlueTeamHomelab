# BlueTeamHomelab
Blue-team homelab built by Andrew and Austin Nguyen

Project: This repository is documentation of our homelab including the steps we took to implement features and build our homelab from the ground up. This project follows Corey Jones' Proxmox homelab series as a guide, but uses different hardware and different network setup.
